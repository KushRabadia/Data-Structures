# Data-Structures & Algorithms
An <b>algorithm</b> can be defined as a finite sequence of instructions, each of which has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finite length of time. While a <b>data structure</b> is a way of organizing all data items that considers not only the elements stored but also. their relationship to each other.
